# Text Detection System

This project is a Python-based OCR (Optical Character Recognition) benchmarking system developed in Google Colab. It extracts text from images using multiple OCR engines ‚Äî Tesseract, EasyOCR, and optionally AWS Textract ‚Äî and compares their accuracy using Jaccard similarity.

## Features

- Supports three OCR engines:
  - üßæ Tesseract (open-source)
  - üß† EasyOCR (deep learning-based)
  - ‚òÅÔ∏è AWS Textract (cloud-based, optional)
- Compares OCR output with ground truth derived from image filenames
- Calculates Jaccard similarity score for performance evaluation
- Works directly in Google Colab using Google Drive for storage
- Exception handling for robust image processing

## Folder & File Structure

My Drive/
‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ TesseractVSEasyOCRVSAWSTextract/
‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ data.zip # Zip file containing all input images

Each image should be named with its ground truth text using underscores (e.g., `hello_world.png` ‚Üí ground truth: "hello world").
